### Welcome To My GitHub! 

***

Hi, my name is Victoria (she/her)! I'm a web developer attending Lambda School.

I'm currently working on team-based projects for my cirriculum, though you might see a side project pop up every now and again. I'm interested in full stack web development, but when I'm not doing that you can catch me cooking or playing games with my friends. 

If you're a junior developer, feel free to ask me about getting into JavaScript, React, or Python. If you're looking to collaborate, feel free to shoot me a message on your project! You can reach me at topham.victoria@gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-topham/).
